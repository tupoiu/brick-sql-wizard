A quick project I made to learn how to use the Brick terminal UI library. It's a port of my friend Randy's SQL generator code which took in input using only getLine and putStrLn. The project provides an interface to write the SQL commands for adding users, revoking permissions, changing a user's password for PostgreSQL.
